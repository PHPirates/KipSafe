It may be necessary to check 'install from unknown sources' to install the app.

Features:

* Alarm repeats every day
* Customize how long before sunset the alarm should go off
* Cancel alarm by closing the egg
* Alarm makes rooster sound

Uses a [sunset api](http://sunrise-sunset.org/api) and therefore needs internet connection.

Warning: trying to destroy the egg by continuous tapping may break the database for a short time.
