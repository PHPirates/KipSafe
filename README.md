It may be necessary to check 'install from unknown sources' to install the app.

Expected behaviour: When you release the chick(en)s into the garden, hit the egg. One hour before sunset the app will dispatch a notification to all phones with the app installed to not forget to put the chick(en)s to sleep. Uses [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/) and a [sunset api](http://sunrise-sunset.org/api) and therefore needs internet connection.

Warning: trying to destroy the egg by continuous tapping may break the database for a short time.
